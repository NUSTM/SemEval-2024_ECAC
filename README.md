# SemEval-2024 Task 3: The Competition of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations

We organize an ECAC evaluation, namely the Competition of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, as a shared task of [SemEval-2024](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/tasks).

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Please note that the use of additional annotation data is not allowed for ECAC. However, we encourage participants to utilize publicly available Large Language Models, including ChatGPT, during system development.

## Task
We first clarify the definitions of emotion and cause before introducing the task. 
- **Emotion** is a psychological state associated with thought, feeling and behavioral response. In conversations, emotions are usually annotated at the utterance level. In our dataset, emotion categories are Ekman‚Äôs six basic emotions including *Anger*, *Disgust*, *Fear*, *Joy*, *Sadness* and *Surprise*. 
- **Cause** refers to the objective event or subjective argument that triggers the corresponding emotion.

Based on the multimodal conversational emotion cause dataset [ECF](https://github.com/NUSTM/MECPE), we define two subtasks, each of which contains two slots.

![example](https://github.com/NUSTM/SemEval-2024_ECAC/raw/main/example.png)

### Subtask 1: Textual Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations
In Subtask 1, an emotion cause is defined and annotated as a textual span. 
- **Slot 1: Emotion Cause Extraction**  Extracting the corresponding textual cause spans given a target emotion utterance in a conversation. As shown in Figure 1, given the Joy emotion in Utterance 3 (U3), the system needs to extract the cause that triggers this emotion in terms of a textual span, i.e., U2\_‚ÄúYou made up!‚Äù.
- **Slot 2: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction**  Extracting all emotion-cause pairs from the given conversation, where each pair contains an emotion utterance along with its emotion category and the textual cause span, e.g., (U3\_Joy, U2\_"You made up!").

### Subtask 2: Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations

It should be noted that sometimes the cause can not be reflected in text only, and we accordingly propose a multimodal subtask to extract emotion cause in all three modalities (language, audio, and vision). For example, the cause for Phoebe‚Äôs Disgust in U5 is that Monica and Chandler were kissing in front of her, which is reflected in the visual modality of U5. In this case, cause is defined and annotated at the utterance level.

- **Slot 1: Emotion Cause Extraction**  In consideration of three modalities, extracting the corresponding cause utterances given the target emotion utterance, e.g., given the Disgust emotion in U5, to predict the cause utterance U5.
- **Slot 2: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction**  In consideration of three modalities, extracting all emotion-cause pairs in the conversation, where each pair contains an emotion utterance along with its emotion category and a cause utterance, e.g., (U5\_Disgust, U5).

Evaluation data will be released on SemEval's timeline.

## Evaluation Metrics

Similar to the previous works, we adopt Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1 as the evaluation metrics. 

Specifically, for Subtask 1 which involves the textual cause span, we adopt two strategies to determine whether the span is extracted correctly: Strict Match (the predicted span should be exactly the same as the annotated span) and Fuzzy Match (the predicted span and the annotated one overlap).
