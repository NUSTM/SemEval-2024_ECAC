We organize an ECAC evaluation, namely Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, as a shared task of [SemEval-2024](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/tasks).

üéâüéâüéâ Our **task paper** is available [here](https://aclanthology.org/2024.semeval-1.277/). Please [cite](#Citation) it according to the official format.

üåüüåüüåü We welcome interested colleagues to join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/ecf_eca) and submit their results to our [CodaLab Competition](#CodaLab) website.


## Task

![example](https://github.com/NUSTM/SemEval-2024_ECAC/raw/main/example.png)

Based on the multimodal conversational emotion cause dataset [ECF](https://github.com/NUSTM/MECPE), we define the following two subtasks:

### Subtask 1: Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations
In this subtask, an emotion cause is defined and annotated as a textual span. 

- Input: a conversation containing the **speaker** and the **text** of each utterance.
- Output: all emotion-cause pairs, where each pair contains an **emotion utterance** along with its **emotion category** and the **textual cause span** in a specific **cause utterance**, e.g., (U3\_Joy, U2\_"You made up!").

### Subtask 2: Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations

It should be noted that sometimes the cause can not be reflected in text only, and we accordingly propose a multimodal subtask to extract emotion cause in all three modalities (language, audio, and vision). For example, the cause for Phoebe‚Äôs Disgust in U5 is that Monica and Chandler were kissing in front of her, which is reflected in the visual modality of U5. In this case, cause is defined and annotated at the utterance level.

- Input: a conversation including the **speaker**, **text**, and **audio-visual clip** for each utterance.
- Output: all emotion-cause pairs, where each pair contains an **emotion utterance** along with its **emotion category** and a **cause utterance**, e.g., (U5\_Disgust, U5).

## <span id="Dataset">Dataset</span>

To access the dataset **ECF 2.0**, please refer to the [data](https://github.com/NUSTM/SemEval-2024_ECAC/tree/main/data) folder.

- **Training data**: the ECF dataset
- **Evaluation data**: the additionally annotated test set

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Please ensure that the data is used exclusively for research purposes!

üîî Note that the use of additional annotation data is not allowed for ECAC. However, we encourage participants to utilize publicly available Large Language Models, including ChatGPT, during the system development and evaluation phases.


## Evaluation Metrics

- Similar to the previous works, we evaluate the emotion-cause pairs of each emotion category with **F1** scores separately and further calculate a weighted average of F1 scores across the six emotion categories (*Anger*, *Disgust*, *Fear*, *Joy*, *Sadness* and *Surprise*).
- For Subtask 1 which involves the textual cause span, we adopt two strategies to determine whether the span is extracted correctly: Strict Match (the predicted span should be exactly the same as the annotated span) and Proportional Match (considering the overlap proportion between the predicted span and the annotated one).

üì¢ You can find the details of the evaluation metrics on [GitHub](https://github.com/NUSTM/SemEval-2024_ECAC/blob/main/CodaLab/evaluation).
